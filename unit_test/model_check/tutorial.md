# Tutorial on using ESBMC to formally verify functions/flows
short intro of model checking.
a short intro of ESBMC, with a small example. 
explain what kind of bugs can be detected.
## ESBMC intrinsic functions
## How to write assumptions/assertions
## Verifying small scale functions
use libspdm version sorting as an example

## Dealing with complexity
### Dealing with loops
### Breaking down long/complicated functions
